# Inception for Content Site
Content site are websites that are heavy in content and have less requirements in other functions. Examples are news portal website and large content repository website.

Content site has a heavy focus on design and content management. The use cases are generally well-known and established.

Content site is generally managed by a large organisation with slow and unpredictable response time. This is due to the multiple levels of management and approvals needed.

Agile inception for content site is geared towards solving the above challenges while maintaining changability and speed of development.

## Agenda
The agenda for a content site inception is:
- Round of introduction of participants
- High level overview of project by product owner
- Product goals
- Design goals
- Business goals
- Non-goals
- Risks (No voting)
- User roles
- User story generation (Sitemap-based)
- Swim lanes
- Retrospective

Note that workflow mapping can be added if there is a need for it.

Goals are conducted in a group discussion cum interview style.

### Non-Goals
Non-goals are things that we will not do.

Generally, we will state the below limitations:
- IE 10 and above, latest Chrome, Firefox and Safari
- Latest mobile Chrome and Safari
- Linux only
- English only
- Singapore market only
- Within 6 sprints

## How Timeline is Managed
Due to the slow approval rate, development will pause in between approval phases. Hence, client will not be charged for man day during pausing.

However, this imposes tremendous resource planning blockage for Futureworkz. Therefore, client must agree to allow up 2-3 working days whenever we resume development.

In total, the project will not exceed the agreed number of sprints else client will be charged for additional man days.

Futureworkz tracks man days used via Hubstaff.
