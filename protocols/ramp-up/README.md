# Ramp Up
You are a new coder joining Futureworkz. First of all, welcome to the Futureworkz family! Because you are hired by us, we believe you have the potential, coding skills and most importantly, the desire to become great in coding.

This document serves to ramp up your coding to Futureworkz's coding standard so that you can start being productive for the company as fast as possible. Please read the document carefully and ask your mentor (or any other coders) if you have any questions.

## Mentor
We will assign a coding mentor to you. This will be the person whom you look for when you are in doubt.

## Read our Playbook - All of it
We painstakingly write and update our playbook so that everyone in the company is aligned and work towards a common goal. 

Please read the entire playbook. Take notes, ask questions and try to understand as much as possible from the playbook. This will help you to get into the Futureworkz culture quickly.

Here's the link to our playbook: http://github.com/futureworkz/playbook

## Drills
There are many best practices to code a project in the world. Futureworkz adopts a set of best practices that are optimized for our development needs. All the best practices are captures in our [drills](../drills/README.md).

You should go through all the drills and make sure you master them. Repeat the drills more than 2-3 times to really master it. (Yes it is boring but it is effective)

Do not follow the drills blindly. Ask your mentor why we do things this way or that way.

All the things you learn in our drills will be applied in your daily work. Consult your mentor if you want to do things that deviate from our drills and make sure you have a good reason for doing so.

## Tea Break Presentation
We have Ruby presentation during tea break every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. This is a 20 minutes presentation by each coder. You are expected to attend the presentation. 

As all coders are required to do this presentation, you will also be doing a presentation when it is your turn.

More information about the tea break presentation can be found [here](../tea-break-presentation/README.md).

## Code Review
We practice code review for coder's education and code quality assurance. You will be assign a code review buddy and all your code (before committing to staging or production) will have to be reviewed by your buddy.

More information about our code review practice can be found [here](../code-review/README.md).

## Ruby Evaluation Test
As you are a new coder, your default coder rank will be D which means you will be taking the Ruby evaluation test every alternate Saturday. This test is compulsory.

Please read our [Ruby evaluation test](../ruby-evaluation-test/README.md) carefully and ask any questions if in doubt.

The test will be a measure of your improvement over time.

## eBooks
Futureworkz invests in our coder education. We have a repository of ebooks on Ruby, Rails and technical development. You are strongly encourage to read the ebooks to improve yourself. 

You can access the ebooks at: https://drive.google.com/a/futureworkz.com/folderview?id=0B_Xbxe-RlZUsRmVYLWl1Ykx1ZzQ&usp=sharing

## Where to Start?
> To eat an elephant, you take one bite at a time.

Begin by knowing who is your mentor.  
Buy him a coffee or lunch (or beer) to know him better.

Next, read everything in the [playbook](http://github.com/futureworkz/playbook).

After the playbook, practice the [drills](../drills/README.md) until you are know clearly our coding standards and you are able to do it without referring.

Take about 2-3 days to do the above and after you are done, inform your mentor.

Next you will be assigned to pair program or co-develop with a coder. Your code will have to follow our [code review practice](../code-review/README.md). Learn as much as possible from the coder who is reviewing your work.

There will be a [Ruby evaluation test](../ruby-evaluation-test/README.md) in the following Saturday or next Saturday. Be prepared for it. Remember our drills and learn as much as possible from your code reviews and you should do just fine.

As a new coder, we will be evaluating your coding skills and your improvements through the Ruby evaluation test and also from peer reviews through code reviews.

When you are getting more comfortable with Futureworkz, you can start reading the [ebooks](https://drive.google.com/a/futureworkz.com/folderview?id=0B_Xbxe-RlZUsRmVYLWl1Ykx1ZzQ&usp=sharing) that we have.

## A Final Note
Are you feeling overwhelmed? Good. :)

If you really love coding, what you experience here will be intense, challenging but insanely fun and exciting. So don't worry about your result. Give your 100% mind, body and soul into your work and enjoy your job!

YOLO!
